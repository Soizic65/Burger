# Burger

Burger is an app that lets you create and devour burgers. It uses Node, Express, and Handlebars to display a list of burgers stored in a mySQL database. The hamburgers that have been "made" get added to the database and displayed on the left of the screen with an option to "Devour It" alongside the name of the burger. Once the burger is devoured, it moves to the right side of the screen. Below there is an input to allow the user to create their own burger.
